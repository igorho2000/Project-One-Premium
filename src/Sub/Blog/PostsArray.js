            "p","I don’t recall when it started, but to my knowledge, I’ve always had an obsession with museums and exhibitions. Whenever I visit someplace new, my first instinct has always been to visit the most acclaimed museum in the area and I have rarely been disappointed. One of my favorite museums is the Nazi Documentation Center in Nuremberg, Germany. The storyline was compelling, the visitation route was well-designed, and the message conveyed was extremely powerful. It was a surreal experience.", 
            "p","In my senior year in college, I joined TEDxNationalTaiwanUniversity as the Director of Planning. I wasn’t that into TED talks but one of the key responsibilities of the job caught my eye. The Director of Planning was in charge of curating the annual exhibition. As a museum geek, I just couldn’t pass up the opportunity to curate my own exhibition. So, here’s the story of how my team and I curated the best exhibition in organization history.",
            "h", "PREPARATIONS",
            "p","I was appointed to the position in late August along with the directors of other departments. We were scheduled to interview prospective members to join the team in late September so that left us one month to prepare. The first thing I did was meet with my predecessor to get a broad picture of what I was about to undertake. She said that for the previous exhibition they set up a few posters in a 10-square meter space. She also mentioned that simply completing that small exhibition was exhausting and they nearly didn’t finish on time.",
            "p","I didn’t believe a word she said.",
            "p","We are often limited simply by our lack of ambition. After I related my predecessor’s comments to the other directors, I proclaimed indignantly that the exhibition I plan on curating would be at least ten times as ambitious as the previous one. During the same meeting, the directors voted to hold the exhibition in mid-December which will leave my future team only 2 months to prepare. Despite the impending challenges, within a week, I completed a barebones proposal for the basic structure of the exhibition and then promptly rented the largest exhibition space in our school (300-square meters).",
            "h", "ASSEMBLING THE TEAM AND BRAINSTORMING",
            "p","Due to my ambition, the design department was added to the curating team to supply the necessary manpower required to pull off this difficult feat. My department was in charge of deciding the theme of the exhibition and subsequent content creation. The design department was in charge of designing and constructing the exhibits. Our two departments also assisted each other’s tasks regularly throughout the organizing stage.",
            "p","My newly recruited department members went straight to work after joining the team in early October. The first item to be determined was the core storyline of the exhibition. After much deliberation, we decided to tell the story of a typical Taiwanese college student and explore the impacts he or she may face. We would first invite the visitor to reflect on shocks in their own lives before leading them on to explore regional and global paradigm shifts. The exhibition would end with a space intended for personal contemplation. The final version of the exhibition consisted of 6 areas.",
            "p","We named the exhibition At the Day’s End, a poetic proclamation taken from one of Tagore’s books.",
            "h", "Description of the 6 Areas that was Released to the Public",
            "s", "1. The Swirl of Sorrow: ",
            "p","In this area, we start with the audio exhibition, in which we use pure sounds to demonstrate peer pressure and appearance anxiety. Being hunted by the pandemic, we are lost, losing our lives as well, drowning in the swirl of sorrow. ",
            "s", "2. Yearnet: ",
            "p","Here, we discuss the conflicts between echo chambers that are formed by the algorithm of the internet. The generation of Net that we yearned for is now tearing our society apart. ",
            "s", "3. Falling of the Stars: ",
            "p","This area explores the concept of democratic recession which is triggered by the rise of populism and the conflicts in society during the pandemic. Sadly, some people now are suffering from the Falling of the Stars and the decaying of democracy. ",
            "s", "4. Scars on the Surface: ",
            "p","This area reveals tragedies such as wars, human rights abuses, discrimination, and environmental disasters. All the sorrows left scars on the surface, waiting to be soothed.",
            "s", "5. Into the Spectrum: ",
            "p","This topic conveys that everyone’s perspectives and opinions are as diverse as the colors exhibited on the light spectrum. Let us head into the spectrum, valuing all voices no matter political standing, race, or gender.",
            "s", "6. Walk Through the Shadow: ",
            "p","Although the pandemic shocked all aspects of the world, we can still walk through the shadow together. Eventually, our missing lives could be retrieved.",
            "h", "DESIGNING AND CONSTRUCTING",
            "p","After determining the structure of the exhibition, my team went to work on honing the details of each area. At the same time, the design department was hard at work designing various aspects of the exhibition.",
            "i", "0-1.png",
            "c","The Main Visual of the Exhibition. Design: Coco Huang.",
            "p","Due to the scale of the exhibition, there were tons of exhibits and props that we had to make by hand beforehand. I won’t go into great detail regarding the construction aspect of the exhibition. However, it should be noted that more than 2,000 manhours went into creating every physical detail of the exhibition. This number alone should signify the great effort our team put into the exhibition. At the end of this article, I will showcase some snapshots of the exhibition.",
            "h", "MARKETING",
            "p","It would be a great shame if no one visited our exhibition. For reference, the previous exhibition attracted under 100 visitors in five days. As such, I put a lot of emphasis on marketing. My team members shot promo films, recorded documentaries, and hosted numerous physical promo events. We also put together a website (which is unfortunately offline) as well as a ticketing system.",
            "h", "PUTTING EVERYTHING TOGETHER",

            "p","We held the exhibition for a total of 4 days. During that time, we attracted more than 500 visitors, a 400% increase from the previous year. More than 99% of our visitors have reported positive experiences during the exhibition.",
            "p","This was one of the hardest and most fulfilling experiences in my life. The sheer amount of tasks I had to execute and manage during the two-month organizing period challenged me to my limit. However, given the chance, I’ll gladly do it again.",
            "h", "ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS",
            "p","The exhibition wouldn’t have been possible without the help of my partner, Julie, and team members.",
